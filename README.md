Lessons I Learned : 

- How to structure a clean and organized HTML project
- Writing custom CSS to design modern, responsive sections
- Integrating Swiper.js for the first time (client logo carousel)
- Creating a complete landing page that feels realistic
- Hosting and deploying a live website on GitHub Pages


Challenges I Faced :
- Making Swiper.js work with my custom layout
- Ensuring consistent hover effects across all buttons and sections
- Finding and formatting proper client logos
- Making sure the entire site looks good on mobile and desktop

 What I'd Improve Next Time :
- Make the contact form functional with a backend (like Formspree or Firebase)
- Add scroll-based animations using AOS.js or GSAP
- Use SASS or CSS variables for better scalability and theming

What's Next?
- Rebuild the project using **React** or **Next.js** to practice component-based development
- Add a blog section with filters and categories
- Connect to a CMS like **Contentful** or **Sanity.io**
- Improve accessibility and SEO optimization


Building this was a super fun experience and helped me grow as a frontend developer. 💪
